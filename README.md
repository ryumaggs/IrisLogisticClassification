# IrisLogisticClassification
Short Data Science project using the iris data set

Iris Data Link: https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Iris

Language: R

Goal: Classify three different types of iris's based on given features (sepal length, sepal width, petal length, petal width)

Dataset format: 150 x 5 matrix, each row is an entry, and each column corresponds to a feature (in the order given above)

Code:
  Implements gradient descent and vectorized logistic regression.
  Implements one vs all classification.
